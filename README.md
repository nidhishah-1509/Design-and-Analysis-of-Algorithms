# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms
<h2>This repository contains basic implementations of common algorithms using C++. It includes examples from topics like searching, sorting, dynamic programming, graphs, and more. The codes are written for learning and reference purposes, focusing on clarity and simplicity. </h2>

<b> Contents </b>
  1. Searching Algorithms
      - Linear Search - Implements a basic linear search algorithm to find an element in an array.
  2. Sorting Algorithms
      - Merge Sort - Sorts an array using the quick sort technique (divide and conquer).
      - Quick Sort - Demonstrates merge sort with recursive splitting and merging.
  3. Graph Algorithms
      - Kruskal's Algorithm - Finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph using Kruskalâ€™s algorithm.
      - MinMax Dynamic Programming - Solves a problem using dynamic programming with a min-max strategy.
      - Longest Common Subsequence - Contains implementations related to the LCS problem using dynamic programming.
  4. Other Topics
      - Coin Toss - Solves the coin toss problem using recursion or DP (e.g., number of possible outcomes).
      - Time Complexity Analysis - Contains code samples to analyze time complexity through counting operations.
      - Arrays - Practice problems or functions involving arrays.
